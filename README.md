# Calico Docker Ubuntu Vagrant example

This example shows how to network Docker containers using Calico with Docker.

### A note about names & addresses
In this example, we will use the following server names and IP addresses.

| hostname   | IP address   |
|------------|--------------|
| calico-01  | 172.17.8.101 |
| calico-02  | 172.17.8.102 |

## Set up your cluster

1) Install dependencies

* [VirtualBox][virtualbox] 4.3.10 or greater.
* [Vagrant][vagrant] 1.6 or greater.
* [Git][git]

2) Clone this project and get it running.

    git clone https://github.com/Metaswitch/calico-ubuntu-vagrant.git -b general
    cd calico-ubuntu-vagrant

3) Startup and SSH

Use vagrant to create and boot your VMs.

    vagrant up

To connect to your servers
* Linux/Mac OS X
    * run `vagrant ssh <hostname>`
* Windows
    * Follow instructions from https://github.com/nickryand/vagrant-multi-putty
    * run `vagrant putty <hostname>`

4) Verify environment

You should now have two Ubuntu servers, with Consul and Etcd running on the first server.

At this point, it's worth checking that your servers can ping each other.

From calico-01

    ping 172.17.8.102

From calico-02

    ping 172.17.8.101

If you see ping failures, the likely culprit is a problem with the VirtualBox network between the VMs.  You should check that each host is connected to the same virtual network adapter in VirtualBox and rebooting the host may also help.  Remember to shut down the VMs with `vagrant halt` before you reboot.

You should also verify each host can access etcd.  The following will return an error if etcd is not available.

    curl -L http://$ETCD_AUTHORITY/version

And finally check that Docker is running on both hosts by running

    docker ps

## Try out Calico Networking

Now you have a basic two node Ubuntu cluster setup and you are ready to try Calico neworking.

Follow the step by step [Getting Started][using-calico] instructions in the main calico-docker repo.
